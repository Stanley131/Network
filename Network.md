# Network Layer
1. Goal
  - understand principles behind network layer services, foucusing on
    data plane: 
      - netwrok layers service models 
      - forwarding verus models 
      - how a router works 
      - generalized forwarding
  - instatiation, implementation in the internet 
2. Network layer 
  - transport segment from sending to receiving host
  - on sending side encapsulates segments into datagrams 
  - on receiving side, delivers segments to transport layer 
  - network layer protocols in every host , router 
  - router examines header fields in all IP diagrams passing though it

3. Two key network-layer functions 
  - network-layer functions:
    - forwarding: move packets from routers' input to appropriate router output 
    - routing: determine route taken by packtes from source to destination 
4. Network layer: data plane, control plane 
  - data plane:
